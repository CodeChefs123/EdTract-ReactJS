## Problem Statement, Background & Motivation, and Solution

### Problem Statement

The extensive use of social media among college students has far-reaching implications for the educational landscape. Exposure to irrelevant and harmful content impacts academic performance and emotional stability. Additionally, the unequal distribution of information within Sri Lanka limits access to quality education for marginalized students. Addressing these challenges is essential for promoting equitable opportunities and breaking the cycle of poverty.

### Background & Motivation

During our schooling years, we lacked a specific platform to connect with our schoolmates. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this issue, leading to stress and loneliness due to limited social interaction. Students turned to social media, which exposed them to negative effects like increased stress, cyberbullying, and decreased well-being. EdTract aims to provide a safer alternative for educational and extracurricular interaction.

### Solution

EdTract is a web-based platform where students can interact with peers from different schools securely. It facilitates communication on educational matters and extracurricular activities, aiming to improve the education of 4.2 million students in Sri Lanka. The platform offers various features to foster collaboration, reduce social media usage, and bridge the digital divide.
